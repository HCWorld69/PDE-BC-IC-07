Trying to modify the TDTR code to include the beam-offset method, you need to do the following steps:

- Define the beam-offset distance as a parameter and the in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor as a function of the sample orientation²³. For example, if the beam-offset distance is 10 microns and the thermal conductivity tensor is K = [[kx, 0], [0, ky]], you can write:

```python
d = 10e-6 # beam-offset distance
def K(theta): # thermal conductivity tensor as a function of angle
    kx = 10 # in-plane thermal conductivity along x-axis
    ky = 5 # in-plane thermal conductivity along y-axis
    c = np.cos(theta) # cosine of angle
    s = np.sin(theta) # sine of angle
    return np.array([[kx*c**2 + ky*s**2, (kx - ky)*c*s], [(kx - ky)*c*s, kx*s**2 + ky*c**2]]) # rotated tensor
```

- Modify the heat diffusion equation to include the beam-offset term and the in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity term²³. For example, if the heat diffusion equation is dT/dt = k*del2(T), you can write:

```python
def dTdt(T, t): # heat diffusion equation with beam-offset and anisotropy
    theta = np.arctan2(y, x) # angle of each point
    k = K(theta) # thermal conductivity tensor at each point
    kx = k[0, 0] # thermal conductivity component along x-axis
    ky = k[1, 1] # thermal conductivity component along y-axis
    kxy = k[0, 1] # thermal conductivity component along xy-axis
    dTdx = np.gradient(T, x, axis=0) # temperature gradient along x-axis
    dTdy = np.gradient(T, y, axis=1) # temperature gradient along y-axis
    d2Tdx2 = np.gradient(dTdx, x, axis=0) # second derivative of temperature along x-axis
    d2Tdy2 = np.gradient(dTdy, y, axis=1) # second derivative of temperature along y-axis
    d2Tdxdy = np.gradient(dTdx, y, axis=1) # mixed derivative of temperature along xy-axis
    return -kx*d2Tdx2 - ky*d2Tdy2 - 2*kxy*d2Tdxdy + Q(x - d, y, t) - Q(x + d, y, t) # heat diffusion equation with beam-offset and anisotropy
```

- Solve the heat diffusion equation using the **odeint** function. For example, if you want to use the initial temperature of 300 K and the evaluation times from 0 to 10 ns with 100 steps, you can write:

```python
T0 = np.full((nx, ny), 300) # initial temperature
t = np.linspace(0, 10e-9, 100) # evaluation times
T = odeint(dTdt, T0, t) # solution
```

- Calculate the thermoreflectance signal using the **fft** function. For example, if you want to use the modulation frequency of 10 MHz and the reflectivity coefficient of 0.01, you can write:

```python
f = 10e6 # modulation frequency
R = 0.01 # reflectivity coefficient
S = fft(T[:, ny//2, nx//2]) # thermoreflectance signal at the center point
S = S * np.exp(-2j*np.pi*f*t) # phase shift due to modulation
S = S * R # reflectivity change due to temperature change
```

- Plot the thermoreflectance signal using the **matplotlib.pyplot** library. You can plot the signal as a function of time or as a function of frequency. For example, you can write:

```python
plt.plot(t, S.real, label='In-phase') # plot in-phase signal vs time
plt.plot(t, S.imag, label='Out-of-phase') # plot out-of-phase signal vs time
plt.xlabel('Time (s)') # label the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Thermoreflectance signal (a.u.)') # label the y-axis
plt.legend() # show the legend
plt.show() # show the plot
```

or

```python
plt.plot(f, S.real, label='In-phase') # plot in-phase signal vs frequency
